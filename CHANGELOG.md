# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Notes]
The comments above about changelogs and semantic versioning start about 2022-09-05.  I'm trying to be better about
documenting things now, but earlier versions of Ratchet don't necessarily fully follow semantic versioning.

Alpha releases are exactly what they sound like - places where I am trying out new things that aren't ready for prime
time, but I need published to see how they interact with the rest of my software ecosystem.  If you use an alpha
package without knowing why it is alpha you'll get exactly what you deserve.

## [Unreleased]
- All my work to date on making Ratchet ESM friendly is in cw/feat/esm .   See the README for my current rant on the state
 of this

## In Flight

## [4.0.x]
### Added
- Memory based sync lock implementation to simplify testing

### Changed
- Switched to AWS Library V3.x since they are now deprecating the 2.x one.  This has a number of backwards incompatibilities,
and I took the opportunity to clean up some API inconsistencies since it was going to be broken anyway.  This version
uses the AWS-preferred method of sending command objects to a more generic HTTP client, and also uses the AWS provided
mock library instead of mocking everything manually with Jest (for non-AWS stuff, Jest mocks are still used).  This handles
some issues with type overloading in the AWS library itself.
- Moved most of the AWS classes into sub-folders for better organization
- Changed StopWatch pretty significantly to always start a default timer, and remove the need for that parameter
